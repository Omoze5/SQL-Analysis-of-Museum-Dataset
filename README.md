The SQL analysis was carried out on a museum dataset that was gotten from kaggle. I identified the most popular artist, determined the top 5 museums based on the number of paintings, pinpointed museums open every day of the week, and highlighted the most expensive canvas. Additionally, I cleaned the dataset by identifying and removing museums with invalid data and deleting duplicate records.
